# J.A.T.E.: A Text Editor!

![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## Description

In this Module 19 Challenge, we used an [existing application's starter code](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/cautious-meme) to build a single-page Progressive Web Application (PWA): a text editor that can be used online or installed and used locally, offline! We implemented methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database using a package called `idm`. This app was deployed on Heroku, so you can visit it here:
